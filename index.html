        <p>The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript-based technology stack used for building modern web applications. It consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, making it a full-stack development framework. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that efficiently stores and manages data in a flexible JSON-like format. Express.js is a lightweight backend framework that simplifies routing and middleware integration for Node.js applications. React.js is a powerful frontend library that provides a component-based approach to building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Node.js serves as the runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side, making MERN a highly efficient and scalable stack.</p>
        <p>One of the key advantages of the MERN stack is that it uses JavaScript for both frontend and backend development, ensuring seamless integration and reducing the need for multiple programming languages. This leads to faster development cycles and easier code maintenance. The stack is well-suited for building single-page applications (SPAs), real-time applications, and e-commerce platforms due to its high performance and scalability. Additionally, Reactâ€™s virtual DOM improves rendering efficiency, while MongoDB's schema-less structure provides flexibility for handling complex data models. With strong community support and an extensive ecosystem, the MERN stack is a preferred choice for developers looking to build modern, high-performing web applications.</p>
